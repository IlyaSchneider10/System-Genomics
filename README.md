# Summary of the project:

The main focus of our work lied on the analysis of single cell mRNA sequencing data from patients with a bipolar disease and a control group from Akula et al. 2014 (PMC5560442). We replecated the results from the paper, with the final aim to obtain a list of differentially expressed genes and then compared the functionality of the genes we found with the ones presented in the paper. A more detailed summary of the steps and the pipeline can be found in the "Final Presentation" file.
